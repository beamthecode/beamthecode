​So I think instead of dipping my toe in the water, I am just going to jump straight in. It's a little more my style. I am a passionate person, I have to love what I am doing. I am a creative being. I think that creating has always been one of the tools I use to stay relevant to myself. I love to bring ideas to life. I love to see a bigger picture, and then get into the weeds. *The devil is in the details as they say*... as maddening as that can be from time to time. *Haha... patience remember*.

From an early age I was drawn to music. I started playing bass guitar with some friends in high school. We started a band. Good camaraderie, but for me it has grown into a life long outlet. Now I play several instruments, and it is a great creative process. I have played shows across the midwest and self released several albums! It's all very independent, and I keep it art focused. To me, it is just a great form of expression. It is so much fun. 

>This same passion for creativity and delivering on ideas is what has lead me to developing. The reward of being able to visualize an idea and then grow that idea from a seed to a living plant. It's something that I cannot get enough of. The fact that we can benefit other people through our solutions is something I love. I find that so good for my soul. Whether it is a solo project or working on a team project, I have always found serving other people to be such a rewarding experience. To have the potential to benefit other peoples lives, even in the smallest of ways is such gift. It is something that I want to deliver on.

A little more fun stuff about me... I am from Northeast Missouri. I grew up in the country. I went to school in a small town. I had to have a good imagination growing up. I think I have that to thank for my creativity. I love playing music, going to the performing arts, live sports events, traveling new places, local cafes, dives, etc. I love being out in the wilderness, whether it's in the woods or under the stars. I love to read. I love new experiences. I keep an open mind. *There's so much to learn about this life.*

I graduated from Columbia College in 2013 with a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration. I majored in Marketing. For the last ten years I have worked in the accounting field. Life is sort of funny like that. Fresh out of college I was offered a position in accounts payable and I jumped at it. It has been a growth experience, and I have gained a lot of great knowledge along the way. I think some of my greatest skills are being adaptable, critical thinking, problem solving, and multitasking. I was able to sharpen these skills on a daily basis. I look back on that time fondly, but something was always missing from a creative standpoint. I love the reinforcement that developing brings.

I had been thinking about building apps for a while. I thought that it was something that I could potentially be very good at. I can look at a big picture visual and then understand the different components that combine to produce the bigger whole. I also love learning new things. I was curious about the development process, and the practicality. *Apps could solve real world problems, though they could also entertain.*

> I started reading more about them, and it lead me to Codecademy. I did some research and realized that Codecademy was an affordable option to teach myself key concepts and fundamentals. I enrolled in their iOS Developer Career Path. Upon starting the course I quickly realized that developing takes a special combination of creative and analytical thinking that I absolutely love. I was hooked almost immediately. I learned all of the core concepts and syntax while completing the iOS Developer program as well as touching on different algorithms and recursive functions. I built out several apps as well, including my first experience working with Firebase. I even contributed to Codecademy Docs!

>While working through the program I realized that continuous learning was going to be an integral part of my iOS Development career. As soon as I finished the Codecademy program I dove into 100 Days of Hacking with Swift by Paul Hudson. I absolutely loved this course. I was able to start taking the skills I was learning and turning them into my own new ideas. **I gained a much better understanding of the WHY taking this course. Certainly it is good to know how to do something, but WHY are we doing it that way? I like to understand the theory and practice behind the fundamentals. The upstream, the downstream. The overall architecture. I gain a much deeper understanding when I learn the WHY.**
